canto
i
in
the
midway
of
this
our
mortal
life
i
found
me
in
a
gloomy
wood
astray
gone
from
the
path
direct
and
en
to
tell
it
were
no
easy
task
how
savage
wild
that
forest
how
robust
and
rough
its
growth
which
to
remember
only
my
dismay
renews
in
bitterness
not
far
from
death
yet
to
discourse
of
what
there
good
befell
all
else
will
i
relate
discover
there
how
first
i
enter
it
i
scarce
can
say
such
sleepy
dullness
in
that
instant
weigh
my
senses
down
when
the
true
path
i
left
but
when
a
mountain
foot
i
reach
where
clos
the
valley
that
had
pierc
my
heart
with
dread
i
look
aloft
and
saw
his
shoulders
broad
already
vested
with
that
planet
beam
who
leads
all
wanderers
safe
through
every
way
then
was
a
little
respite
to
the
fear
that
in
my
heart
recesses
deep
had
lain
all
of
that
night
so
pitifully
pass
and
as
a
man
with
difficult
short
breath
forespent
with
toiling
scap
from
sea
to
shore
turns
to
the
perilous
wide
waste
and
stands
at
gaze
en
so
my
spirit
that
yet
fail
struggling
with
terror
turn
to
view
the
straits
that
none
hath
pass
and
liv
my
weary
frame
after
short
pause
recomforted
again
i
journey
on
over
that
lonely
steep
the
hinder
foot
still
firmer
scarce
the
ascent
began
when
lo
a
panther
nimble
light
and
cover
with
a
speckled
skin
appear
nor
when
it
saw
me
vanish
rather
strove
to
check
my
onward
going
that
ofttimes
with
purpose
to
retrace
my
steps
i
turn
the
hour
was
morning
prime
and
on
his
way
aloft
the
sun
ascended
with
those
stars
that
with
him
rose
when
love
divine
first
mov
those
its
fair
works
so
that
with
joyous
hope
all
things
conspir
to
fill
me
the
gay
skin
of
that
swift
animal
the
matin
dawn
and
the
sweet
season
soon
that
joy
was
chas
and
by
new
dread
succeeded
when
in
view
a
lion
came
gainst
me
as
it
appear
with
his
head
held
aloft
and
hunger
mad
that
en
the
air
was
fear
struck
a
she
wolf
was
at
his
heels
who
in
her
leanness
seem
full
of
all
wants
and
many
a
land
hath
made
disconsolate
ere
now
she
with
such
fear
erwhelmed
me
at
the
sight
of
her
appall
that
of
the
height
all
hope
i
lost
as
one
who
with
his
gain
elated
sees
the
time
when
all
unwares
is
gone
he
inwardly
mourns
with
heart
griping
anguish
such
was
i
haunted
by
that
fell
beast
never
at
peace
who
coming
er
against
me
by
degrees
impell
me
where
the
sun
in
silence
rests
while
to
the
lower
space
with
backward
step
i
fell
my
ken
discern
the
form
one
of
one
whose
voice
seem
faint
through
long
disuse
of
speech
when
him
in
that

was
among

besought

myself

road
has
met
hindrance
so
great
that
he
through
fear
has
turn
now
much
i
dread
lest
he
past
help
have
stray
and
i
be
ris
too
late
for
his
relief
from
what
in
heaven
of
him
i
heard
speed
now
and
by
thy
eloquent
persuasive
tongue
and
by
all
means
for
his
deliverance
meet
assist
him
so
to
me
will
comfort
spring
i
who
now
bid
thee
on
this
errand
forth
am
beatrice
from
a
place
i
come
note
beatrice
i
use
this
word
as
it
is
pronounced
in
the
italian
as
consisting
of
four
syllables
of
which
the
third
is
a
long
one
revisited
with
joy
love
brought
me
thence
who
prompts
my
speech
when
in
my
master
sight
i
stand
thy
praise
to
him
i
oft
will
tell
she
then
was
silent
and
i
thus
began
lady

whose
influence
alone
mankind
excels
whatever
is
contain
within
that
heaven
which
hath
the
smallest
orb
so
thy
command
delights
me
that
to
obey
if
it
were
done
already
would
seem
late
no
need
hast
thou
farther
to
speak
thy
will
yet
tell
the
reason
why
thou
art
not
loth
to
leave
that
ample
space
where
to
return
thou
burnest
for
this
centre
here
beneath
she
then
since
thou
so
deeply
wouldst
inquire
i
will
instruct
thee
briefly
why
no
dread
hinders
my
entrance
here
those
things
alone
are
to
be
fear
whence
evil
may
proceed
none
else
for
none
are
terrible
beside
i
am
so
fram
by
god
thanks
to
his
grace
that
any
suff
rance
of
your
misery
touches
me
not
nor
flame
of
that
fierce
fire
assails
me
in
high
heaven
a
blessed
dame
besides
who
mourns
with
such
effectual
grief
that
hindrance
which
i
send
thee
to
remove
that

stern
judgment

her
will

to

calling
her
she
thus
bespake
now
doth
thy
faithful
servant
need
thy
aid
and
i
commend
him
to
thee
at
her
word
sped
lucia
of
all
cruelty
the
foe
and
coming
to
the
place
where
i
abode
seated
with
rachel
her
of
ancient
days
she
thus
address
me
thou
true
praise
of
god
beatrice
why
is
not
thy
succour
lent
to
him
who
so
much
lov
thee
as
to
leave
for
thy
sake
all
the
multitude
admires
dost
thou
not
hear
how
pitiful
his
wail
nor
mark
the
death
which
in
the
torrent
flood
swoln
mightier
than
a

him
struggling

any
with
such
speed
haste
to
their
profit
flee
from
their
annoy
as
when
these
words
were
spoken
i
came
here
down
from
my
blessed
seat
trusting
the
force
of
thy
pure
eloquence
which
thee
and
all
who
well
have
mark
it
into
honour
brings
when
she
had
ended
her
bright
beaming
eyes
tearful
she
turn
aside
whereat
i

when

whence
i
was

into
that

through

en
i
wept
at
entering

horrible
languages
outcries
of

accents
of

voices
deep

hoarse
with

the

up
a
tumult
that
for
ever
whirls
round
through
that

with
solid
darkness

with

cried

what

this
i

what

so
overcome
with

thus
to
me
this
miserable
fate
suffer
the
wretched
souls
of
those
who
liv
without

praise
or
blame
with
that
ill
band
of
angels
mix
who
nor
rebellious
prov
nor
yet
were
true
to
god
but
for
themselves
were
only
from

heaven
drove
them
forth
not
to
impair
his

them
lest
th
accursed
tribe
should
glory
thence
with
exultation
vain
i
then
master
what
doth
aggrieve
them
thus
that
they
lament
so
loud
he
straight
replied
that
will
i
tell
thee
briefly
these
of
death
no
hope
may
entertain
and
their
blind
life
so
meanly
passes
that
all
other
lots
they
envy
fame
of
them
the
world
hath
none
nor
suffers
mercy
and
justice
scorn
them
both
speak
not
of
them
but
look
and
pass
them
by
and
i
who
straightway
look
beheld
a
flag
which
whirling
ran
around
so
rapidly
that
it
no
pause
obtain
and
following
came
such
a
long
train
of
spirits
i
should
ne
er
have
thought
that
death
so
many
had
despoil
when
some
of
these
i
recogniz
i
saw
and
knew
the
shade
of
him
who
to
base
fear
yielding
abjur
his
high
estate
forthwith
i
understood
for
certain
this
the
tribe
of
those
ill
spirits
both
to
god
displeasing
and
to
his
foes
these
wretches
who
ne
er
lived
went
on
in
nakedness
and
sorely
stung
by
wasps
and
hornets
which
bedew
their
cheeks
with
blood
that
mix
with
tears
dropp
to
their
feet
and
by
disgustful
worms
was
gather
there
then
looking
farther
onwards
i
beheld
a
throng
upon
the
shore
of
a
great
stream
whereat
i
thus
sir
grant
me
now
to
know
whom
here
we
view
and
whence
impell
they
seem
so
eager
to
pass

as
i
discern
through
the
blear
light
he
thus
to
me
in
few
this
shalt
thou
know
soon
as
our
steps
arrive
beside
the
woeful
tide
of
acheron
then
with
eyes
downward
cast
and
fill
with
shame
fearing
my
words
offensive
to
his
ear
till
we
had
reach
the
river
i
from
speech
abstain
and
lo
toward
us
in
a
bark
comes
on
an
old
man
hoary
white
with
eld
crying
woe
to
you
wicked
spirits
hope
not
ever
to
see
the
sky
again
i
come
to
take
you
to
the
other
shore
across
into
eternal
darkness
there
to
dwell
in
fierce
heat
and
in
ice
and
thou
who
there
standest

get
thee
hence
and
leave
these
who
are
dead
but
soon
as
he
beheld
i
left
them
not
by
other

he
by
other
haven

thou
come

their

i
stood
for

on

me
of

heard
except
of
sighs
that
made
th
eternal
air
tremble
not
caus
by
tortures

from
grief
felt
by
those
multitudes
many

of

know
that
these
of

straight
replied
in

these
all
in

what

more

my

not

for

me
with
tardy

from

while
thus
with
sighs
he
spake

on

down

ix
the

coward

inwardly
restrain

attentive
for

oh
how
long
me
seems
it
ere
the

i
noted
how
the
sequel
of
his
words
clok
their
beginning
for
the
last
he
spake
agreed
not
with
the
first
but
not
the
less
my
fear
was
at
his
saying
sith
i
drew
to
import
worse
perchance
than
that
he

mutilated

ever

this
rueful
concave
extreme
depth

out
of
the

whose
pain
is
deprivation
merely
of

hope
thus
i
inquiring

replied

no

naked

within

he
added
but
i
hold
it
not
in

for
that
mine
eye
toward
the
lofty
tower

drawn
me
wholly
to
its
burning

in

now
there
came
er
the

loud
crashing
terrible
a
sound
that
made

by
that
annoyance

signal
made
that

ah
me

full
of
noble
anger

wore
the

other

soon
as

throw
mine

see
on
every
part
wide
stretching
space
replete
with
bitter
pain
and
torment
ill
as

betwixt

in

spake
they

what
time
they
here
from

thee

thy

the

of
thy

noble
land
with

perchance
i

severely
dealt
sudden

in

thy

as
there
i
stood
at

in
disdainful
mood
address
me
say
what
ancestors
were
thine
i
willing
to
obey
him
straight
reveal
the
whole
nor
kept
back
aught
whence
he
his

somewhat
uplifting
cried
fiercely
were
they
adverse
to
me
my
party

the

from
whence
i
sprang
twice
therefore
i
abroad
scatter
them

driv
out

from

answer
i
return
an
art
which
yours
have
shown
they
are
not
skill
to
learn
then
peering
forth
from
the
unclosed
jaw
rose
from
his

in

then
thus
resum
in

i
stood
not
singly

without
just
cause
assuredly
should
with
the

have
stirr

singly
there
i
stood
when
by
consent

had
to
the

been
raz
the

who
openly
forbad

may
thy

him

thou
solve
this

much
of

scorn

cries
aloud

he
cried
in

phlegraean
warfare
and

full
aim
at
me
with
all
his

he
never

then
thus
my
guide
in
accent
higher
rais
than
i
before
had
heard
him
capaneus
thou
art

next
turning
round

with
milder

he
spake
this
of
the
seven
kings
was
one
who
girt
the
theban
walls
with
siege
and
held
as
still
he
seems
to
hold
god
in
disdain
and
sets
his
high
omnipotence
at
nought
but
as
i
told
him
his
despiteful
mood
is
ornament
well
suits
the
breast
that
wears
it
follow
me
now
and
look
thou
set
not
yet
thy
foot
in
the
hot
sand
but
to
the
wood
keep
ever
close
silently
on
we
pass
to
where
there
gushes
from
the
forest
bound
a
little
brook
whose
crimson
wave
yet
lifts
my
hair
with
horror
as
the
rill
that
runs
from

ran
this

and
each

built

i

thee

spake
my

him
thence
besought
that
having
giv
me
appetite
to
know
the

he
too
would
give
that

they
broke

my

his

i
follow
and
small
space
had
we
pass
onward
when
the
water
sound
was
now
so
near
at
hand
that
we
had
scarce
heard
one
another
speech
for
the
loud
din
en
as
the
river
that
holds

its

unmingled
from

space
enough

thus
downward
from
a
craggy
steep
we
found
that
this
dark
wave
resounded
roaring
loud
so
that
the
ear
its
clamour
soon
had
stunn
i
had
a
cord
that

fast
bound
to

the

i
had

my

i
gather
up

stretch
it
forth
to
him
then
to
the
right
he
turn
and
from
the
brink
standing
few
paces
distant
cast
it
down
into
the
deep
abyss

somewhat
strange
thus
to
myself

spake

so
strange

which
my

with
earnest
eye
thus
follows
ah
what
caution
must
men
use
with
those
who
look
not
at
the
deed
alone
but
spy
into
the
thoughts
with
subtle
skill
quickly
shall

the

bar
his

incurs

my

ten
paces
on

proceeded
soon
as
we
to
him
arrive
a
little
further
on
mine

beholds
a
tribe
of
spirits
seated
on
the

near
the

chasm
forthwith
my

spake
that

thy

this
round
contains

now

till
thou

with
him

will
parley
that
to
us
he
may
vouchsafe
the

of
his
strong
shoulders
thus
alone
yet
forward
on
the
extremity
i
pac
of
that
seventh
circle
where
the
mournful
tribe
were
seated
at
the
eyes
forth
gush
their
pangs
against
the
vapours
and
the
torrid
soil
alternately
their
shifting
hands
they
plied
thus
use
the
dogs
in
summer
still
to
ply
their
jaws
and
feet
by
turns
when
bitten
sore
by
gnats
or
flies
or
gadflies
swarming
round
noting
the
visages
of
some
who
lay
beneath
the
pelting
of
that
dolorous
fire
one
of
them
all
i
knew
not
but
perceiv
that
pendent
from
his
neck
each
bore
a
pouch
with
colours
and
with
emblems
various
mark
on
which
it
seem
as
if
their
eye
did
feed
and
when
amongst
them
looking
round
i
came
a
yellow
purse
i
saw
with
azure
wrought
that
wore
a
lion
countenance
and
port
then
still
my
sight
pursuing
its

beheld
than

more
red
a
goose
display
of
whiter
wing

and
one
who
bore
a
fat
and
azure
swine
pictur
on
his
white

addressed
me
thus
what
dost
thou
in
this
deep
go
now
and
know
since
yet
thou
livest
that
my

here
vitaliano
on
my

shall
sit
a

noble
knight

who

pouch
with
the
three
beaks
will
bring
this
said
he
writh
the
mouth
and
loll
the

out
like
an

no

soon
interpos
her
threat
who
makes
the
servant
bold
in

of

settled
me
upon

that

verse
proceeds
to
torments
new
fit
argument
of
this
the
twentieth
strain
of
the
first
song
whose
awful
theme
records
the
spirits
whelm
in
woe
earnest
i
look
into
the
depth
that
open
to
my
view
moisten
with
tears
of
anguish
and
beheld
a
tribe
that
came
along
the
hollow
vale
in
silence
weeping
such
their
step
as
walk
quires
chanting
solemn
litanies
on
earth
as
on
them
more
direct
mine
eye
descends
each
wondrously
seem
to
be
revers
at
the
neck
bone
so
that
the
countenance
was
from
the
reins
averted
and
because
none
might
before
him
look
they
were
compell
to
advance
with
backward
gait
thus
one
perhaps

how
i
long
could
keep
my
visage
dry
when
i
beheld
near
me
our
form
distorted
in
such
guise
that
on
the
hinder
parts
fall
from
the

the
tears
down
streaming
roll
against
a

the

as

bursts
from

caught
me
ev
as
a
mother
that
from
sleep
is
by
the
noise
arous
and
near
her
sees
the
climbing
fires
who
snatches
up
her
babe
and
flies
ne
er
pausing
careful
more
of

of
herself

but
a
single

clings
round
her
limbs
down
from
the
jutting
beach

he
cast
him
to
that
pendent
rock

closes
on
one
part

other
chasm
never
ran
water
with
such
hurrying
pace
adown
the
tube
to
turn
a
landmill
wheel
when
nearest
it
approaches
to
the
spokes
as
then
along
that
edge
my
master
ran
carrying
me
in
his
bosom
as
a
child
not
a
companion
scarcely
had
his
feet
reach
to
the
lowest
of
the
bed
beneath
when
over
us
the
steep
they
reach

fear
in
him
was
none

that
high
providence
which
plac
them
ministers
of
the
fifth
foss
power
of
departing
thence
took
from
them
all
there
in
the
depth
we
saw
a
painted
tribe
who
pac
with
tardy
steps
around
and
wept
faint
in
appearance
and
ercome
with
toil
caps
had
they
on
with
hoods
that
fell
low
down
before
their
eyes
in
fashion
like
to
those
worn
by
the
monks
in
cologne
their
outside
was
overlaid
with
gold
dazzling
to
view
but
leaden
all
within
and
of
such
weight
that
frederick
compar
to
these
were
straw
oh
everlasting
wearisome
attire
we
yet
once
more
with
them
together
turn
to
leftward
on
their
dismal
moan
intent
but
by
the
weight
oppress
so
slowly
came
the
fainting
people
that
our
company
was
chang
at
every
movement
of
the
step
whence
i
my
guide
address

that
thou
find
some
spirit
whose

may
by
his
deeds
be
known
and
to
that
end
look
round
thee
as
thou
go

then
one
who
understood
the
tuscan
voice
cried
after
us
aloud
hold
in
your
feet
ye
who
so
swiftly
speed
through
the
dusk
air
perchance
from
me
thou
shalt
obtain
thy
wish

my
leader
turning
me
bespake
pause
and
then
onward
at
their
pace
proceed
i
staid
and
saw
two
spirits
in
whose
look
impatient
eagerness
of
mind
was
mark
to
overtake
me
but
the
load
they
bare
and
narrow
path
retarded
their
approach
soon
as
arriv
they
with
an
eye
askance
perus
me
but
spake
not
then
turning
each
to
other
thus
conferring

this
one

by
the
action
of
his
throat
alive

dead

privilege
allows

unmantled
by

to

fro
wailing

forth

some

first
maintain
with
his

he
open
wide
his
arm
and
took
me
up
as
one
who
while
he
works
computes
his
labour
issue
that
he
seems
still
to

the

lifting
me
up
to
the
summit
of
one
peak

fix
his

soon
to
mourning
changed
from
the

a
whirlwind
sprung

at
her
foremost
side

strike
the

whirl
her
round
with
all
the

lifted
up

over

upward
rose

still

no

now
pass
on
with
leave
from
the
mild
poet

when
following
came
another
from
whose
top
a
sound
confus
forth
issuing
drew
our
eyes
that
way
to
look
as
the
sicilian
bull
that
rightfully
his
cries
first
echoed
who
had

its

so
rebellow
with
the

him
tormented
that
the
brazen
monster
seem
pierc
through
with
pain
thus
while
no
way
they
found
nor
avenue
immediate
through
the
flame
into
its
language
turn
the
dismal
words
but
soon
as
they
had
won
their
passage
forth
up
from
the
point
which
vibrating
obey
their

descended
still

my

was
livelier
to

unweeting

therefore
cast

ever
at
thy

such
wrangling

a
joy
for
vulgar
minds

the
very
tongue
whose
keen
reproof
before
had
wounded

that

now
minister
my

so
have
i
heard
achilles
and
his
father
javelin
caus
pain
first
and
then
the
boon
of
health
restor
turning
our
back
upon
the
vale
of
woe
cross
th
encircled
mound
in
silence
there
was
twilight
dim
that
far
long
the
gloom
mine
eye
advanc
not
but
i
heard
a
horn
sounded
aloud
the
peal
it
blew
had
made
the
thunder
feeble
following
its
course
the
adverse
way
my
strained
eyes
were
bent
on
that
one
spot
so
terrible
a
blast
orlando
blew
not
when
that
dismal
rout
erthrew
the
host
of
charlemagne
and
quench
his
saintly
warfare
thitherward
not
long
my
head
was
rais
when
many
lofty
towers
methought
i
spied
master
said
i
what
land
is
this
he
answer
straight
too
long
a
space
of
intervening
darkness
has
thine
eye
to
traverse
thou
hast
therefore
widely
err
in
thy
imagining
thither
arriv
thou
well
shalt
see
how
distance
can
delude
the
sense
a
little
therefore
urge
thee
on
then
tenderly
he
caught
me
by
the
hand
yet
know
said
he
ere
farther
we
advance
that
it
less
strange
may
seem
these
are
not
towers
but
giants
in
the
pit
they
stand
immers
each
from
his
navel
downward
round
the
bank
as
when
a
fog
disperseth
gradually
our
vision
traces
what
the
mist
involves
condens
in
air
so
piercing
through
the
gross
and
gloomy
atmosphere
as
more
and
more
we
near
toward
the
brink
mine
error
fled
and
fear
came
er
me
as
with
circling
round
of
turrets
montereggion
crowns
his
walls
en
thus
the
shore
encompassing
th
abyss
was
turreted
with
giants
half
their
length
uprearing
horrible
whom
jove
from
heav
yet
threatens
when
his
mutt
ring
thunder
rolls
of
one
already
i
descried
the
face
shoulders
and
breast
and
of
the
belly
huge
great
part
and
both
arms
down
along
his
ribs
all
teeming
nature
when
her
plastic
hand
left
framing
of
these
monsters
did
display
past
doubt
her
wisdom
taking
from
mad
war
such
slaves
to
do
his
bidding
and
if
she
repent
her
not
of
th
elephant
and
whale
who
ponders
well
confesses
her
therein
wiser
and
more
discreet
for
when
brute
force
and
evil
will
are
back
with
subtlety
resistance
none
avails
his
visage
seem
in

as
doth
the
pine
that
tops
saint
peter
roman
fane
and
th
other
bones
of
like
proportion
so
that
from
above
the
bank
which
girdled
him
below
such
height
arose
his
stature
that
three
friezelanders
had
striv
in
vain
to
reach
but
to
his
hair
full
thirty
ample
palms

expos
downward
from
whence
a
man
his
garments
loops

so
shouted
his
fierce
lips

sweeter

my

address
him
thus
senseless

let
thy

for
thee
interpret
therewith
vent
thy
rage
if

thy

thou
find
the

that
binds
it
on
wild
spirit
lo
upon
thy
mighty
breast
where
hangs
the
baldrick
then
to
me
he
spake
he
doth
accuse
himself
nimrod

this
through
whose
ill
counsel
in
the
world
no
more
one
tongue
prevails
but
pass
we
on
nor
waste
our
words
for
so
each
language
is
to
him
as
his
to
others
understood
by
none
then
to
the
leftward
turning
sped
we
forth
and
at
a
sling
throw
found
another
shade
far
fiercer
and
more
huge
i
cannot
say
what
master
hand
had
girt
him
but
he
held
behind
the
right
arm
fetter
and
before
the
other
with
a
chain
that
fasten
him
from
the
neck
down
and
five
times
round
his
form
apparent
met
the
wreathed
links
this
proud
one
would
of
his
strength
against
almighty
jove
make
trial
said
my
guide
whence
he
is
thus
requited
ephialtes
him
they
call
great
was
his
prowess
when
the
giants
brought
fear
on
the
gods
those
arms
which
then
he
piled
now
moves
he
never
forthwith
i
return
fain
would
i
if
were
possible
mine
eyes
of
briareus
immeasurable

next
he
answer
thou
shalt
see
not
far
from
hence
antaeus
who
both
speaks
and
is
unfetter
who
shall
place
us
there
where
guilt
is
at
its
depth
far
onward
stands
whom
thou
wouldst
fain
behold
in
chains
and
made
like
to
this
spirit
save
that
in
his
looks
more
fell
he
seems
by
violent
earthquake
rock
ne
er
shook
a
tow
so
reeling
to
its
base
as
ephialtes
more
than
ever
then
i
dreaded
death
nor
than
the
terror
more
had
needed
if
i
had
not
seen
the
cords
that
held
him
fast
we
straightway
journeying
on
came
to
antaeus
who
five
ells
complete
without
the
head
forth
issued
from
the
cave
thou
who
in
the
fortunate
vale
that
made
great
scipio
heir
of
glory
when
his
sword
drove
back
the
troop
of
hannibal
in
flight
who
thence
of
old
didst
carry
for
thy
spoil
an
hundred
lions
and
if
thou
hadst
fought
in
the
high
conflict
on
thy
brethren
side

as

that
through
thine

scornfully
distort
thy

he
in
the

renown
on
thee

thus
spake
the
teacher
he
in
haste
forth
stretch
his
hands
and
caught
my
guide
alcides
whilom
felt

as
my
guide
had
felt
it
he
bespake
me
thus
this
way
that
i
may
clasp
thee
then
so
caught
me
up
that
we
were
both
one
burden
as
appears
the
tower
of
carisenda
from
beneath
where
it
doth
lean

then
antaeus

mark
him
stooping
i
were
fain
at
times
have
pass
another
way
yet
in
th
abyss
that
lucifer
with

ingulfs
lightly

plac

full
springing

not

and
with
falt

i

no

wretched

had
ye
here
on
earth
been
flocks
or
mountain
goats
as
down
we
stood
in
the
dark
pit
beneath
the
giants
feet
but
lower
far
than
they
and
i
did
gaze
still
on
the
lofty
battlement
a
voice
bespoke
me
thus
look
how
thou
walkest
take
good
heed
thy
soles
do
tread
not
on
the
heads
of
thy
poor
brethren
thereupon
i
turn
and
saw
before
and
underneath
my
feet
a
lake
whose
frozen
surface
liker
seem
to
glass
than
water
not
so
thick
a
veil

that

not

creak
as

the
frog
croaking
above
the

what
time
in

the
village
gleaner
oft
pursues
her
toil
so
to
where
modest
shame
appears
thus
low
blue
pinch
and
shrin
in
ice
the
spirits
stood
moving
their
teeth
in
shrill
note
like
the
stork
his
face
each
downward
held
their
mouth
the
cold
their
eyes
express
the
dolour
of
their
heart
a
space
i
look
around
then
at
my
feet
saw
two
so
strictly
join
that
of
their

the
very

were
mingled
tell
me

thus
together
press
said
i
who
are
ye
at
that
sound
their
necks
they
bent
and
when
their
looks
were
lifted
up
to
me
straightway
their
eyes
before
all
moist
within
distill
upon
their

the
frost
bound
the

at

passing

with
such

i
am

perchance
was
my
reply
if

be

to
thee
that
with
the
rest
i

seizing

i
cried

thee

not

tarry
here
rend
all

he
answer
yet
for
that
i

thee

at
my

thou
pluck
a

now
i
had
grasp
his

stript
off
more
than

barking
with

cried
what

sound
not

enough
thy

thou

the

misgave
him
through
his

i
heard
at
its

underneath

up

horrible
tower
whence
uttering
not
a

i
shed
no

another
sun
came
out
upon
the

when
a
faint
beam
had
to
our
doleful
prison
made
its
way
and
in
four
countenances
i
descry
the
image
of
my
own
on
either
hand
through

i
bit

they
who

it
through

rose

off
from
us

not
to
make
them
sadder
i
kept
down
my
spirit
in
stillness
that
day
and
the
next
we
all
were
silent
ah
obdurate

died

the

when
the
wings
enough
were
op
caught
fast
the
shaggy
sides
and
down
from
pile
to
pile
descending
stepp
between
the
thick
fell
and
the
jagged
ice
soon
as
he
reach
the
point
whereat
the
thigh
upon
the
swelling
of
the
haunches
turns
my
leader
there
with
pain
and
struggling
hard
turn
round
his
head
where
his
feet
stood
before
and
grappled
at
the
fell
as
one
who
mounts
that
into
hell
methought
we
turn
again
expect
that
by
such
stairs
as
these
thus
spake
the
teacher
panting
like
a
man
forespent
we
must
depart
from
evil
so
extreme
then
at
a
rocky
opening
issued
forth
and
plac
me
on
a
brink
to
sit
next
join
with
wary
step
my
side
i
rais
mine
eyes
believing
that
i
lucifer
should
see
where
he
was
lately
left
but
saw
him
now
with
legs
held
upward
let
the
grosser
sort
who
see
not
what
the
point
was
i
had
pass
bethink
them
if
sore
toil
oppress
me
then
arise
my
master
cried
upon
thy
feet
the
way
is
long
and
much
uncouth
the
road
and
now
within
one
hour
and
half
of
noon
the
sun
returns
it
was
no
palace
hall
lofty
and
luminous
wherein
we
stood
but
natural
dungeon
where
ill
footing
was
and
scant
supply
of
light
ere
from
th
abyss
i
sep

thus
when
risen
i
began
my
guide
vouchsafe
few
words
to
set
me
free
from
error
thralldom
where
is
now
the
ice
how
standeth
he
in
posture
thus
revers
and
how
from
eve
to
morn
in
space
so
brief
hath
the
sun
made
his
transit
he
in

thus
answering
spake
thou
deemest
thou
art
still
on
th
other
side
the
centre
where
i
grasp
th
abhorred
worm
that
boreth
through

thou
wast
on
th
other
side
so
long
as
i
descended
when
i

thou
didst
erpass
that

from
ev

the

that
was

there
evening
sets
and

whose

was

standeth
fix
as
at
the
first
on

he
fell
down
from

th
earth
here
prominent

through

of
him
did
veil
her
