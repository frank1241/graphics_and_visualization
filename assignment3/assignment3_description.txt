This project visualizes and analyzes the words used in the novel "The Vision of Hell" by Dante Alighierl. The extract_words python script
extracts all the the words without punctuation used in the novel, finds the unique words, and also the number of words that occured at each
frequency. A Wordle Word cloud was used to visualize all the words used in the novel initially. Then the unique words were analyzed 
and displayed on a canvas in the a3_novelvisualization processing script. The words were color coded according to their word length.
Finally the number of words that occured at each frequnecy were visualized using a barchart. From the barchart it appears that 
there were a large number of words that occured only once while only a few number of words occured many times.
